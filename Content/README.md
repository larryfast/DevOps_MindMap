### Introduction
This repo contains an Obsidian Vault that generates an associative graph of DevOps concepts. 
### DevOps Mind Map
The image below is generated by Obsidian from a source tree of .md files. Look below for Obsidian setup instructions.

Currently this is the work of a single autho. I came to DevOps as a developer so the map is current biased toward development concerns. Like so much of DevOps collaboration is needed to bring other domains into focus.
