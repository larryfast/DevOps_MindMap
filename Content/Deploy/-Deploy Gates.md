- An aspect of the [[Anti-Pattern]]s that often hamstring CICD attempts
	- Deployment gates
	- Approvals
	- Manual checklists
	- or any human involvement breaks the CICD model
- Blocks anything faster than a weekly deploy process.
- MITIGATION
	- Identify the root causes for each Gate
	- Investigate the conditions that would relieve the need for a gate
		-  Often this can be traced back to insufficient monitoring or automated testing
	- Do it SAFELY!
		- Upgrade the CICD Pipeline to relieve the need for the gate
		- Retain the Gate UNTIL the Gate process is always coming up clean
			- IE automated testing or monitoring always catches the problem before you hit the Gate
