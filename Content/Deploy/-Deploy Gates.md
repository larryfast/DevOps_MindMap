### -Deploy Gates
- An aspect of the [[Anti-Pattern]]s that often hamstring CICD attempts
- Deployment gates, approvals, manual checklists or any human involvement breaks the CICD model
- Blocks anything faster than a weekly deploy process.
- MITIGATION
	- Identify the root causes for each Gate
	- Investigate the conditions that would relieve the need for a gate
		- This is often insufficient automated testing
	- Do it SAFELY!
		- Build the relief into the CICD Pipeline
		- Retain the Gate UNTIL the Gate process is always coming up clean
