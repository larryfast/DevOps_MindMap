### Flow vs Batch
- [[Flow]] vs [[-Batch Release]]
- WHY FLOW?
	- FLOW is the most time efficient production process
	- BATCH actions inherently require extra handling steps
- 99% of Companies use Batch software deploy to Production
- 89.33% use batch deploy to UAT
- BATCH is an anti-pattern because
	- A collection of new code is tested as a group.
	- The source of each problem must be diagnosed as "which changed caused this?"
	- "Is change XYZ in this batch?"
	- Developers wait longer to get test results
		- This often means developers move on to new tasks
		- They need to re-engage with older work to fix issues
			- No longer in the groove
			- Fixes can be inconsistent with original design
- The goal is Flow, but what does that mean?
	- Batch size = ONE! One coding task
	- Each Task is delivered to UAT when the developer says DONE
	- If there's a bug, there's only one possible source
	- In full CICD each Task is separately delivered all the way to Production!
		- This is NOT easy. Many testing and pipeline services must be fully operational before this can work
- How do we get there?
	- Sanity testing must be FAST. IE. Automated
	- Manual testing is moved out of the Pipeline
	- IE. system critical, automated testing is part of the Pipeline
	- Manual testing can still be done but should not be mission critical and should not block the Pipeline
- Flow Examples from other domains - always looking for better examples
