### Bottling Plant
- WHY FLOW?
- FLOW is the most time efficient production process
- 
- Imagine a Coding Task is like a pop bottle. 
	- Each coding assignment is a Bottle
	- Filling with liquid is your UAT environment
	- The Cap is deploying to your Production Environment
- Modern bottling plants put all the bottles onto a conveyor
	- Each bottle is filled and capped individually
	- By a Complex set of machinery
	- A FLOW of bottles propagates through the system


- First round of improvement
	- UAT gets a new code drop weekly or daily
		- To keep up with the deploy pace, testcases get automated
	-
