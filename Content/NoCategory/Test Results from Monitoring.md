### Test Results from Monitoring
- Automated testcase development and maintenance can be significantly simplified by gathering test results from the Central Monitoring service
- Test case design can be split into two main components: Actions and Observations
- Actions often require direct connection to specific target systems. This pattern doesn't help with Actions.
- Observations also often require information from multiple sources. BUT those sources can push the needed observation data to the centralized monitoring service
- Then testcases don't need explict connections to every data source. They only need to query the monitoring database.
- Timing can become an issue as information availability on the monitoring data is often delayed.
- Batch testing can relieve this problem.
	- Split the testcases into Actions and Observations
	- Execute multiple Actions then batch the Observation component by waiting for a trigger message to appear in the monitoring DB
