### CICD
- [[Flow]]
- Turns the Build and Deploy process into a "single click"
	- It's a rare breed that builds a CICD pipeline all the way to production
	- But every step integrated into an Automated 'CICD' service [[Reduce Cognitive Load]]  for everyone involved
- Anti-pattern = [[-Deploy Gates]]
- [[DevOps Landscape]]
- [[Monitoring++]]
### Continuous comes from Industry
- [[TODOs]] add case studies from other industries
- Bottling Plant?
	- Imagine each code change as a Coke bottle
	- The next bottle enters the conveyor (pipeline)
	- Hits the filling station (build+package)
	- Then gets capped
	- Then racked up into a case
	- Stacked onto a pallet
	- Pushed onto a truck
	- NON STOP!
- Chemical Processing
	- 19th century chemistry was Batch Mode 
		- Make a vat of XYZ, boil, distill, etc, to create a batch of product
	- 20th century replaced this with continuous. Eg. Oil distillation tower
		- Raw oil enters at the bottom and is heated as it rises through the tower
		- At each level in the tower specific chemicals can be extracted based on molecular weight 
		- REQUIRES many additional sensors and internal equipment to manage the flow
