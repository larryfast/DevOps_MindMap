The -ilities
Architects must consider the non-functional requirements of the product. 
- stability
- quality
- maintainability
- [[Release Mgmt]] (releaseability)
- [[Observability]] monitorability
- [[Design for Testability]]
- [[Operations]]
- deployability
- performance
- upgradability
- scalability
- refactorability
- separability - aka [[Microservice]]

The -ilities are foundational. They hide underneath all technologies. If you build something without considering -ilities you could encounter major roadblocks when you realize there's an -ility that was not considered early enough in development.

A good example is Security. It's very hard to improve security by retrofiting an existing system. It often requires gutting key aspects of the system and rebuilding from scratch.
