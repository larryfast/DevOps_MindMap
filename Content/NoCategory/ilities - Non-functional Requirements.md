The -ilities
Architects must consider the non-functional requirements of the product. Performance, stability, quality, maintainability, deployability, monitorability, testability, upgradability.

The -ilities are foundational. They hide underneath all technologies. If you build something without considering -ilities you could encounter major roadblocks when you realize there's an -ility that's important.

A good example is Security. It's very hard to improve security by retrofiting an existing system. It often requires gutting key aspects of the system and rebuilding from scratch.

DevOps is all about the ilities.
