### DevOps Days Unconference
- Classically a conference is a collection of pre-planned speakers and topics.
- DevOps was and still is too diverse for that model to work
- The Unconference is characterized by having about 50% adhoc discussion sessions that are created on the fly.
- Attendees suggest discussion topics on postits then add a tick to topics they're interested in. Then a whirlwind of scheduling assigns rooms and times based on level of interest.
- Unconferences also include a round of rapid fire 5-10 minute presentations called Lightning Talks, _____? or similar
- The goal of all this mayhem is an attempt to cover the vast range of topics that fall under the DevOps umbrella.  To allow attendees to learn from each other and spend more time connecting with people tackling similar challenges.
- The unconference is also a response to challenges that product vendors cannot solve.  DevOps needs all that tech but implementing DevOps in your company is about everything that sits between those technologies.
