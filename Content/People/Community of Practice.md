### 1hr per week DevOps Training Program
[[To Jay - Oct 2022-10-01 - CoP proposal]]
[[People]]

- Current thinking is a monthly 2hr meeting
	- Compare this to Toastmasters
- Modest engagement for busy development teams
	- Most team members will simply show up and follow along. Minimum engagement
	- A few members will be fully engaged. Reading the training materials and asking questions
	- These people will help tailor the course by asking questions relevant to your business
- DevOps adoption problem: death by a thousand cuts
	- Everyone has concerns like, "that won't work here"
	- Focus on the concepts and directions
	- Suspend your disbelief and listen with an open mind
	- Many of these processes are only successful in combination
	- Many will, in fact, not apply here
	- So it's important that I hear from you!
	- DevOps is about discovery and tuning
	- More about craftsmanship than technology
	- EXAMPLE: Navy airgapped old systems
- History, First Principles & Reduce Cognitive Load
	- State of DevOps annual report shows companies that adopt DevOps perform better than those that don't. Real Accounting Performance!
	- and adoption continues to grow
	- Initially developed by the Unicorns, the trickle down, a flood really, of tooling and techniques has made DevOps available to everyone. Well, everyone that makes the effort to understand and adopt it.
- Gestalt
	- I'll try not to over use Wholistic, Gestalt or synchronicity but the truth is that many DevOps solutions simply won't work in isolation.
- History
	- In the early 2000s, the FANGs hit the wall.  Monolithic software had gotten too big to succeed. The cost of ever larger software projects grows exponentially. This cost curve is easily explained. More people means more time spent on communication.  Code complexity also grows exponentially and suffers the same fate.
	- Even if the cost of growth was linear something like Google would collapse under its own weight.  Lets look at servers per sysadmin, for example. Classically one sysadmin can handle about 30 servers.  Google today would need about 50,000 sysadmins. And that doesn't count all the developers and other staff involved.
	- 
	- The survivors of Internet 1.0 were companies that figured out how to slay the exponential dragon and find ways to scale up to ridiculous sizes without collapsing. They didn't just beat that dragon once.  They have to continuously reinvent themselves and beat down exponential complexity over and over and over again.
	- It wasn't called DevOps back then.  The term DevOps got coined in 2009 after a seminal conference presentation  [[Flikr Velocity 2009]]
	- Subsequently the meme took off through the success of   [[DevOps Days Unconference]]
- Today trickledown from the FANGs has spawned an insane collection of vendors selling us products that promise DevOps success. We need those tools to successfully implement DevOps. Unfortunately DevOps is more about how you use those tools than the tools themselves.
- So how do we slay the exponential dragon? Capital A Automation.
		- It's a glib answer that's not particularly helpful but it's the honest truth.
		- Embracing pervasive automation is an important key.
	- But before we get into that I want to pause and look at [[First Principles]]
