- Deployment gates, approvals, manual checklists or any human involvement breaks the CICD model
- This [[Anti-Pattern]] often hamstrings CICD attempts
- Blocks anything faster than a weekly deploy process.
- MITIGATION
	- Identify the root causes for each Gate
	- Investigate the conditions that would relieve the need for a gate
		- Often this can be traced back to insufficient monitoring or automated testing
	- Do it SAFELY!
		- Don't remove the Gate until improvements render it obsolete
		- Upgrade the CICD Pipeline to relieve the need for the gate
		- Retain the Gate UNTIL the Gate process is always coming up clean
			- IE automation always catches the problem before you hit the Gate
