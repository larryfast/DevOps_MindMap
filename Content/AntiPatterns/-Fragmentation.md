- Decomposition is often a good thing. Eg. partitioning a monolith into microservices. 
	- Decomposition implies a managed process. 
	- Fragmentation has the connotation of unmanaged.

- Every set of code that has some level of isolation or independence from other code has an interface, either explicit or implied. Each interface is a cost. Implicit interfaces are the least visible, hardest to maintain and most costly

- Code fragmentation
- UI fragmentation - Android, Apple, Windows, Mac, Linux
- Toolchain fragmentation - eg. many job specific tools vs fewer generic tools
- Deployment fragmentation - separate VMs, executables, etc

- The DevOps goal is to fully manage all aspects of the product.  Every fragment induces a full suite of management processes.
