- Everything you do becomes a Technical Debt. Nothing is future proof.
- New versions of packages, tools, operating systems, etc get released
- Or worse, become obsolete
- Versioning of all your infrastructure should be tracked and monitored. Every component should have a best before date.
- Regularly review the status of all aging components. 
- Monitor the amount of aging tech debts and don't let it pile up
